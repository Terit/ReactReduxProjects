Overall these tutorials were a good brush up on React and a solid introduction to using Redux with React. I picked up a few more ES6 shorthand techniques and importing/exporting of modules. This was also my first time using Create-React-App which made the initial project setup painless. After generating the project skeleton, I removed the `src` folder and started from scratch. The other helper that made these projects so quick to create was react-bootstrap.
